This is a change log for the rock paper scissors game.

v0.2

Everything is still working. A new "module" was created with some basic functions to make the code cleaner. 

Future changes:
- Improve winning evaluation through functions that are going to be defined at the beginning of the program or another file 
(latter option seems cleaner) - (DONE).
- A way to track past games with a scoreboard such as TETRIS. OBS: I'm thinking about implementing this using PrettyTable module.
I will probably save a list or a dictionary with info related to past games.
- A way to continue the game from where you stopped last. OBS: I'm still thinking if this actually makes any sense.

Bugs:
The sys module gives a traceback error. I gotta find a better (subtle?) way to end the game.


v0.1

The game simply works. You pick one out of three different options (rock, paper, scissors or quitting the game) and then
the program proceeds to evaluate your choice and ends the game if 'q' is the chosen option. If any other option is chosen,
the game compares your choice to a randomly chosen move (the move is chosen through the random module).
